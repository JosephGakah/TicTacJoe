The AI moves will be powered by the Minimax algorithm, making the game unbeatable at the highest difficulty.
It has three levels: Easy, Medium, Hard

### Objectives
- Understand React State(useState) and React Hooks(useHooks).
- Applying Algorithms into applications e.g Minimax Algorithm for the game
